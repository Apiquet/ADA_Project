# Abstract
A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?
We are going to take the GDELT v2 dataset. As there are many kinds of information, we have several ideas. The main one and certainly the one we are going to take is:
Analysing the protests for leadership change, for rights or for change in institutions or regime around the world. First, we would like to find correlations between
the number of each kind of protest and other variables (richness of the country, the political regime, the year (is there less and less protests in all countries?), etc).
Second, finding a way to visualize each kind of protest on a world map would be interesting. Finally, the goal would be finding an utopian richness level and political
regime. We could face to a wrong result cause of dictatorial regimes where there is no protest, the main point would be finding a way to determine our utopian regime.
